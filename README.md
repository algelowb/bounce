# bounce
This is a fairly simple program that simulates a ball bouncing around in a box. It will bounce forever, without losing energy. 

This is meant to illustrate some very basic concepts of "programmable physics." It is my own simple exploration into the matter.
I'm 99% sure there is an easier way to code something like this, but I like to use what I know so far. I'm still learning! 

The code itself uses some basic line parameterization, so if you don't know what that is, then you can study up just by googling it.

A lot of the code is explained in comments in the file itself. I have some Calculus students I'm tutoring that might be interested
in Python work in the future, so that's why I kept comments outside of the while loop for readability.
